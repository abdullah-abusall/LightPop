========

LightPop is a light weight lightbox that could contain anything

To use LightPop you will only need to add the class  lightpop  to the div you want to use as your model.

Give any element the class  lightpopshow  to use it as a toggle for the LightPop.

Call the function  hidelightpop();  to close LightPop.

Call the function  showlightpop();  to open LightPop (you could use this if you needed lightpop to open on page load).

LightPop is easly customizable just fiddle with the CSS file  lightpop.css  to see what you could do.

Oh yea LightPop is totaly responsive!

Enjoy.
